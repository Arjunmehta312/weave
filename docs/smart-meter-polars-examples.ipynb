    "\n",
    "[Apache Arrow Polars](https://pola-rs.github.io/polars-book/user-guide/) is another powerful library for working with large datasets. It offers excellent performance and a convenient API for data manipulation, particularly when working with parquet files.\n",

    "Key benefits for working with smart meter data:\n",
    "- Lazy evaluation through `scan_parquet`\n",
    "- Efficient filtering and aggregation\n",
